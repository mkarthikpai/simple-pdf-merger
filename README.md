# simple-pdf-merger
Its a simple website used to merge two pdfs
This is purely made using bootstrap and jvascript
In Javascript i have used express js and npm's pdf merger
pdf merger: https://www.npmjs.com/package/pdf-merger-js
express js: https://expressjs.com/en/starter/hello-world.html
There might be an issue once you upload two files and click on submit button
The data might visible as object format instead of a merged pdf which is yet to be fixed.
